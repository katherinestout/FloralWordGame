A new flower word is generated, and the player selects a letter to guess by clicking on a button. If the letter is right, the letter will appear in the designated space under 'correct letters'. If the letter is wrong, it will appear under 'incorrect letters.' The player has twenty chances to guess the word. If needed, the player may click on hints and they will be revealed. If twenty guesses are used up, you lose. If you guess the word under twenty guesses, you win. There are an unlimited number of playing turns.

# Built With
